# CPP Visualizer Prompt v1 (ASCII Diagram Only)

Task: Create ONE compact ASCII diagram that represents the given idea sentence.

Input:
Idea: {{IDEA_TEXT}}

Output format (exactly):
Diagram:
<ASCII diagram <= 8 lines OR (none)>

Rules (critical):
- The diagram is a grounding aid, not an explanation.
- Do NOT introduce new concepts beyond what is stated in the idea.
- Prefer structural/relational layouts: Flow, Loop, Tree, Compare.
- Avoid symbols/notation unless explicitly present in the idea sentence.
- Keep labels short. If uncertain, output (none).
